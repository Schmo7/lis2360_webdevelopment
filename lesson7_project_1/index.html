            <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
            <p>Ever since 2009 when the first cryptocurrency was created, the debate as to whether or
                not all digital currencies should be regulated has only heightened. Many feel that as more digital
                currencies are released, the need for fiat currency will decline. This side of the argument also
                believes that there should be more regulation on cryptocurrencies because virtual currencies can
                ultimately challenge government supervision of monetary policy.</p>
            <p>The House Committee on Appropriations noted that “Bitcoins and other forms of peer-to-peer digital currency are a potential means for criminal, terrorist, or other illegal organizations and individuals to illegally launder and transfer money.” </p>
            <p>While increased government regulation on cryptocurrencies may not directly benefit them, it will not lead to the demise of all
                digital currencies. <strong>How our government goes about implementing these regulations will have an
                impact on our economy that would last a lifetime.</strong></p>
            <p>Bitcoin has also succeeded so far as a currency. An article from the New Jersey Institute of Technology states, "The world’s first decentralized currency now an accepted form of payment in dozens of countries around the world. As more countries begin to adopt this innovative technology, it’s clear that Bitcoin has the potential to become the new global currency not tied to a specific country or central bank."</p>
            <p>The basic definition of a virtual currency can be described as “An electronically issued currency of that transferability which into fiat is not guaranteed by the state,” Jan Lansky writes. This essentially means that every cryptocurrency holds no set value and that value is determined by the market.</p>

            <p><em><strong>At its core, Bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers. It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in                transactions... all good things ~Peter Diamandis</strong></em></p>
